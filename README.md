- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @callmebongos, a student of Games Technology and Software Engineering
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in both Games Dev and Software Engineering, and I've worked on quite a few projects - both passion projects and university work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a text based dungeon crawler RPG called "Unpaid Overtime"
  This is a game where the protagonist is a chronically underpaid office worker who made the mistake of staying late one evening to print some things and is now stuck, with his only escape being climbing the corporate ladder.
