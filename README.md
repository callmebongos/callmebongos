- 👋 Hi, I’m @callmebongos, a student at UWE Bristol
- 👀 I’m interested in game development
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a text based dungeon crawler RPG called "Unpaid Overtime"
  This is a game where the protagonist is a chronically underpaid delivery worker who made the mistake of staying late one evening and is now having some spooky stuff happen.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game dev projects
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord at callmebongos
